# Brutaldon

Brutaldon is a [brutalist][0], [Web 1.0][0.5] web interface for [Mastodon][1]. It is not a Mastodon-compatible social networking server; rather, it is just a client, like the Android or iOS client for Mastodon you may already be using, but it runs in a web server, and is accessed through a web browser. The web browser that brutaldon targets is [Lynx][2]. Of course, you can use it in a more heavy-weight graphical browser, as well as other text browsers such as [w3m][3] or [elinks][4].

## Aesthetic

No automatic page updates: refresh the page to see new toots. No endless scroll: there's a "next page" link. No autocompletion of anything: use another lynx process in another screen window to look things up. UTF8 clean.
